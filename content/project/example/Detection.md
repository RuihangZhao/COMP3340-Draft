In this project, you are supposed to design a tracker for the objects in a video. A detector should be first finetuned 
on KITTI dataset. You can design a tracker based on the object detector with the IoU matching rule. We also encourage 
you to design a more sophisticated tracker, if you would like to explore more interesting works. :)
