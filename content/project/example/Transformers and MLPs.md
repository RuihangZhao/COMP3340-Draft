**Image Classification Using MLP-based Model**

<br>

In this project, you need to implement at least one MLP-based model (e.g., MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, gMLP) based on 
MMClassification codebase; You need to train your model on the Category Flower Dataset, which contains 17 category flower 
dataset with 80 images for each class. After training, you need test your model on the validation set. Bonus: Implement 
more than one MLP-based models and discuss their similarities and differences.
