**Detect Covid-19 from chest X-ray image**

<br>

In this project, you need to train a Covid-19 Classification model, which can detect Covid-19 from Chest X-ray images. 
You first train the Classification model with the training set of Covid-19 Dataset, which contains Chest X-ray image of 
different abnormalities (“Covid-19”: the first row; “Lung Opacity”: the second row; “Viral Pneumonia”: the third row;) 
and health person. After training the model, you need to predict the semantic label of Chest X-ray Image from the test 
set of Covid-19 Dataset.
