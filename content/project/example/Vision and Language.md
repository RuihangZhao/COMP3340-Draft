In this project, you are asked to design and implement an automated captioning method on GIFs, which could be trained 
end-to-end. Different from image captioning, GIFs have a series of continuous frames with both appearance and motion 
information. You may report the performance of the model and improve the caption quality by introducing novel modules.
