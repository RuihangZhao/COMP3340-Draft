## Project Overview

<br>

The Course Project is an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in the class to a problem of your interest. 
Potential projects usually fall into these two tracks:

- **Applications.** If you're coming to the class with a specific background and interests, 
we'd love to see you apply ConvNets to problems related to your particular domain of interest. 
Pick a real-world problem and apply ConvNets to solve it.
- **Models.** You can build a new model (algorithm) with ConvNets, or a new variant of existing models, 
and apply it to tackle vision tasks. This track might be more challenging, and sometimes leads to a piece of publishable work.

You can work in teams of up to **5** people. We have a total of **13** topics for your choice, 
and each team can bid on **5** topics. We will assign an appropriate topic for each team according to the overall bidding.

To inspire ideas, you might also look at recent deep learning publications from top-tier conferences, as well as other resources below.

- CVPR: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
- ICCV: International Conference on Computer Vision
- ECCV: European Conference on Computer Vision
- NIPS: Neural Information Processing Systems
- ICLR: International Conference on Learning Representations
- ICML: International Conference on Machine Learning

You may consult any papers, books, online references, or publicly available implementations for ideas and code that you 
may want to incorporate into your strategy or algorithm, so long as you clearly cite your sources in your code and your 
writeup. However, under no circumstances may you look at another group’s code or incorporate their code into your project.

## Report Submission

<br>

Please submit your proposal as a PDF using the CVPR template. **Only one person on your team should submit.** Please have 
this person add the rest of your team as collaborators as a “Group Submission”.

<br>

Your final report is required to be **6** pages, structured like a paper from a computer vision conference. Please use the 
template so we can fairly judge all student projects without worrying about altered font sizes, margins, etc.

<br>

The following is a suggested structure for your report, as well as the rubric that we will follow when evaluating reports. 
You don’t necessarily have to organize your report using these sections in this order, but that would likely be a good 
starting point for most projects.

- **Title, Author(s)**
- **Abstract**: Briefly describe your problem, approach, and key results. Should be no more than 300 words.
- **Introduction**: Describe the problem you are working on, why it’s important, and an overview of your results.
- **Related Work**: Discuss published work that relates to your project. How is your approach similar or different from others?
- **Methods**: Discuss your approach for solving the problems that you set up in the introduction. Why is your approach the 
  right thing to do? Did you consider alternative approaches? You should demonstrate that you have applied ideas and 
  skills built up during the quarter to tackling your problem of choice. It may be helpful to include figures, diagrams, 
  or tables to describe your method or compare it with other methods.
- **Experiments**: Discuss the data and experiments that you performed to demonstrate that your approach solves the problem. 
  The exact experiments will vary depending on the project, but you might compare with previously published methods, 
  perform an ablation study to determine the impact of various components of your system, experiment with different 
  hyperparameters or architectural choices, use visualization techniques to gain insight into how your model works, 
  discuss common failure modes of your model, etc. You should include graphs, tables, or other figures to illustrate your 
  experimental results.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize your key results - what have you learned? Suggest ideas for future extensions or new applications of your ideas.

## Final Presentation (video recording)

<br>

We will use video recording as the way for student to present and share their project. Each group is required to submit 
a maximum **5-minute** presentation video for their final project. Students can be as creative as they like for their video 
presentations. The easiest option is to create a slide deck together as a team and record yourselves presenting the slide 
deck as a group using zoom.
