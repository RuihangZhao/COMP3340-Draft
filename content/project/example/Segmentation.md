**Semantic segmentation on SBD dataset**

<br>

In this project, you are required to train a segmentation network on SBD dataset. The dataset contains 715 images chosen 
from existing public datasets. Images from these datasets are mainly outdoor scenes, each containing approximately 
320-by-240 pixels. Then, you may use novel modules to improve the performance of your network.
